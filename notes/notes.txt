To ping parts of the hosts/routers on mininet: mininet> source ping dest
An example: h1 ping r1

Testing code example (after running python script in mininet):
Launch h1 with the command: xterm h1
Launch r1 with the command: xterm r1
On r1, run the compiled router code.
On h1 run the command: ping 10.0.0.1
The router should then take incoming data, figure out what it is, then send the proper reply. h1 will state it has received data after r1 sends it.
